######What I learned now :tada:
* Managing gradle dependencie.
* Working with [ButterKnife] (http://jakewharton.github.io/butterknife/).
* Create progress bar for refresh button. *(I so like it!)*
* Comunication between Android and [DarkSky] (darksky.net) API with [OkHttp] (http://square.github.io/okhttp/).
* Getting network info.
* Using `String.fomat()` for updating string resources.
* Create own DialogFragment for inform user, if something went wrong. 
*(That never seems trough the app, in theory, so I inserting a picture about this, that believe me.)*
